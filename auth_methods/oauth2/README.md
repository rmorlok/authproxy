# OAuth2

This package consolidates the business logic of OAuth2. This includes logic related to managing the authentication flow 
across the different services that participate in it, as well as the proxy methods for OAuth2 and token refresh. 

For more information about what the OAuth flow looks like in the system see [this diagram](../../docs/oauth_flow.puml).
