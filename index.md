# AuthProxy

AuthProxy is an open source, embeddable integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS). It offloads the work of managing
the connection lifecycle to 3rd party systems so your application can call to those systems using an authenticating
proxy and stay focussed on the business logic of your product.
